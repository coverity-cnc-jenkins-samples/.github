|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|                                                                                                                                                                          
| **Scan repository with build as a pre-step (Recommended)** | This is the recommended way to scan. A pre build step guarantees all the compiled code and artifacts are scanned for comprehensive vulnerability detection | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/basic-scan/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/basic-scan/) | 
| **Scan repository in an environment where build is not an option** | This option is less accurate and should be used when you can’t build your repository | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/install-directory-custom-paths/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/install-directory-custom-paths/) |                                                                                                                                             
| **Add comments to PRs for new issues introduced through developer changes** | For each new vulnerable issue introduced by the developer's changes, this integration adds a comment to the pull request. PR comments let the developer quickly view, understand, and fix the issue before merging | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/pr-comments/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/pr-comments/) |                                                                                                                                                                
| **Break build when issues are found in the policy view** | The ability to break or not break a build when issues are found in the policy view. This sample shows you how to configure with the build break options. | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/build-break/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/build-break/) |                                                                                                                                                                
| **Pass advanced Coverity options** | To leverage advanced SAST features, you need to pass options to Coverity. This sample shows how you can configure Coverity options | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/arbitrary-params/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/arbitrary-params/) |                                                                                                                                                           
| **Run scans asynchronously to avoid holding up the pipeline during scanning** | By default, the pipeline waits until the scan finishes. You can configure the workflow so the pipeline returns immediately after starting the scan. Note that post-scan options do not trigger if you choose not to wait for the scan to finish | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/async-mode/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/async-mode/) |
| **Simplified workflow using default configurations for beginners** | Basic workflow demonstrating all Coverity features with default configurations. Ideal for beginners to explore features quickly. A perfect starting point to understand core capabilities without configuration complexity | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/simplified-example/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/simplified-example/) |
| **Detailed workflow with full configurations for advanced users** | Comprehensive workflow demonstrating all Coverity capabilities with full configurations. Ideal for advanced users requiring granular control and customization capabilities | [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/coverity-cnc-workflow-samples/detailed-example/blob/main/.github/workflows/nodejs-npm.yml) | [Results](https://coverity-cnc-workflow-samples.github.io/detailed-example/) |
